# T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics

## Objective
To identify the top 11 T20 cricket players by scraping data from espncricinfo, analyzing it with Pandas, and visualizing the results in a Power BI dashboard to select players with a 90% winning probability.

##  Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of cricket data to select the best players for a T20 cricket team. I utilized several tools and technologies to achieve this goal:

- **Python**: For scripting and automation
- **Web Scraping**: To gather data from espncricinfo using Brightdata
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Power BI**: To create detailed reports and dashboards for player selection

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Scraped data from espncricinfo using web scraping techniques.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Utilized Pandas to clean and transform the raw data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Evaluated various player performance metrics to determine the best players.
4. **Visualization**: Created a Power BI report and dashboard to visually select players for different categories (openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers).
5. **Team Selection**: Used the Power BI dashboard to choose the top 11 players with a high probability of winning.

## Results
The selected team, based on the Power BI dashboard, has a 90% chance of winning the game.
